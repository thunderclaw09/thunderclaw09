- 👋 Hi, I’m @thunderclaw09
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and coding, and perhaps small collaborations with friends.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning nothing in particular, but I like Python!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple python projects that wouldn't be too hard. 
- 📫 How to reach me: (Not up yet; maybe once I need it)

I like Python, C#, the Unity Game Engine, and Linux.
